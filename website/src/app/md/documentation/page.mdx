# Contribute Documentation

Writing good documentation is hard. Any contribution towards having a better documentation is highly profitable. Thank you a lot for reading this tutorial.

## Doc-comments

Doc-comments, short for documentation comments, are special comments in source code that are specifically formatted to provide documentation for the
associated code.

These comments serve as a source of reference documentation for noogle,
offering valuable information about the purpose, functionality, and usage of the code elements they document.

## Placement

Please place your doc-comments as shown below.

```nix
/**Doc comment for foo*/
foo = x: x;
```

Sometimes the placement shown above won't work out.
In any case you can place the documentation directly before the lamba. (only whitespace allowed)

```nix
/**Doc comment*/
x: x;
```
