# Functors in nix

**Functors combine functions and attribute sets**

## Understanding Functors

A functor is a polymorphic data type that can represent both a 
**lambda function** (`x: x`) and an **attribute set** (`{ key = value; }`). 

This means that the Atribute set can hold data in the form of attributes.

And also be a lambda function that can operate on that data. 

-> The lambda function can access the attributes of the attribute set often called `self`.

## Examples of Functors

In the following example, `build` is both an attribute set and a lambda.
`__functor` is a reserved attribute name that turns the attribute set `build` into a **functor**.

```nix
{
  build = {
    foo = 1;
    __functor = self: _arg: self.foo;
  };
}
```

The attribute set `build` can now be used as a lambda via `function application`. 

```nix
nix-repl> build "linux"
=> 1
```

But at the same time `build` is still an Attribute set.

```nix
nix-repl> build
=> { __functor = «lambda»; foo = 1; }
```

## Applications of Functors

Functors find practical applications including some in nixpkgs:

- `lib.makeOverridable`
- `lib.setFunctionArgs`
- `lib.mirrorFunctionArgs`
- `lib.types` and `lib.options` 
- and many more.

## When to use a functor

(Noogle opinion)

The use of functor should be avoided and is often **unnecessary**. 

Using them can add up in **complexity** and makes is hard to learn and maintain a certain piece of code.
