We are excited to announce the release of a groundbreaking version of Noogle.

# Noogle release 2024-1

Noogle has evolved into a versatile toolset, empowering new and experienced users.

Its underlying toolset can render doc-comments seamlessly into markdown, HTML, or JSON formats.

A lot of knowledge and experience that I have gained while creating [RFC145](https://github.com/NixOS/rfcs/blob/master/rfcs/0145-doc-strings.md) and working on other automated documentation tools has gone into this new version.

## Limitation

Source links point to my autogenerated fork of nixpkgs. 

This will be solved within the next weeks.

current ly nixpkgs doesnt fully support markdown in doc-comments yet. Although the RFC145 is accepted things need to be done.

Please feel free to contribute there.
