# Typing 

As the nix language has no static types we use 
Type informations in doc-comments to communicate type expectations, behaviors and abstract interfaces.

In this short tutorial your will learn how to properly type a nix function, such that it can be discovered by noogle and most imporantantly understood by other developers.

## Primitives 

|Type | Description  |
|---|---|
| Bool | A value of type boolean can be either `true` or `false`  |
| Int | The classical integer type |
| Float | A float with 64 bits |
| String | A string of any unicode characters |
| Path | Path referencing a location or a file. With no assumptions on the existence of that |
| Null | The value null |
| Never | The bottom type. e.g. the function `builtins.abort` which returns `Never` |

## Complex

`T`, `U`, ...; are placeholders for any types, those MUST be specifically declared on usage

| Annotation | Type  | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `[ T ]` | List  | List of elements with type `T` each |
| `{ U::T }` | AttrSet  | AttrSet where member `N` references value of type `T` |
| `T -> U` | Lambda  | A function that takes a single argument of type `T` and returns a value of type `U` |

## Common Aliases

Sometimes common aliases for more complex types can be used. 

They are composed from other types as follows

| Type  | Composition | Description  |
|---|---|---|
| `Derivation` | see [builtins.derivation](/f/builtins/derivation) | is just a special AttrSet. see [builtins.derivation](/f/builtins/derivation) |
| `Any` | `?` | There is no `Any` type. Avoid using it. Use type variables (e.g. `a -> b`) instead if you want to allow variable type signatures. |
| `Number` | `Int {or} Float` | The `Number` is either of type `Int` or of type `Float` |
| `StorePath` | `Path` | The `StorePath` is just a meaningful alias of the type `Path` |

## Examples

These examples should give you a short feeling of correctly using type signatures.

```haskell
bitOr :: Int -> Int -> Int
```

```haskell
map :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
```

```haskell
map :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
```

```haskell
mapAttrs :: (String -> a -> b) -> { ${name} :: a } -> { ${name} :: b }
```

> In some cases it is very hard and complex to describe all behaviors. Keep it simple.

Entering the last and likewise important chapter, 'Operators'

## Operators

__All Operators SHOULD be used with surrounding whitespace.__

### `::` declares the type

e.g. `name :: String`

### `()` Parenthesis

Parenthesis to clarify order of type evaluation

e.g. `( a -> b ) | Bool`

Precedence: (Highest)

### `;` Separator for subsequent entries (like in AttrSet)

e.g. `{ foo :: Number; bar :: String }`

> Currently this is very inconsistent in nixpkgs.
> 
> Lets improve here

### `|` syntactic or

syntactic `Or` can be used for composition or enums

Precedence: 2

#### Special Cases

```hs
Any | a
```

Is always `Any`; Because any other type `a` must already be a subtype of any, due to the definition of `Any`.

```hs
b | Never
```

Is always `b`; Due to the definition of `Never`; `b` must be a supertype of `Never`.

### `...` - arbitrary input values

can only be used within an AttrSet to allow any more `name-value pairs`.

`...` = `${rest} :: a` within an AttrSet context

Precedence: None

### `->` arrow operator

Allows for lambda types

Precedence: 1

### `?` optional arguments in an AttrSet

--e.g.  `{ opt ? :: Int }`

Precedence: None
